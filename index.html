                    Every citizen should have input, via a vote, as to who is elected. Enormous amounts of money are expended by political campaigns to engage with voters, and so fundraising has become a major activity by candidates. Donations are an additional way for constituents to get involved in political races. Unions and corporations are able to donate though Political Action Committees (PACs), while the 2010 Citizenâ€™s United ruling by the US Supreme Court has removed caps on corporate donations via PACs and allowed campaign ads to be published or broadcast anonymously.

                    Develop models to predict the impact on electoral outcomes of contributions and spending by campaigns and donors, and use these to develop recommendations for where funds should be directed. Students will be encouraged to identify metrics for effectiveness of donations and campaign spending. What characterizes the most effective donation or spending? Where should it be directed?  Is this effectiveness getting more or less pronounced over time? What other factors and data may need to be brought into the analysis?
